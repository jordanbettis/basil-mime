                    BASIL MESSAGE HANDLING LIBRARY
                    
                            Build Tools

This directory contains a set of files to ensure that the Basil
library is up-to-date with the registry of MIME content types and
character sets maintained by IANA.

SUBTYPE DEFINITION GENERATION:

The files,

generate_all_subtypes.sh,
generate_subtype.py, and
content_subtypes_skeleton.ads

are used to produce the content subtype definitions stored in
../generated. If everything goes well, it should be sufficient to run
generate_all_subtypes.sh. Please note that you need wget, html2text,
and python installed. You also need a web connection with access to
fetch the files from IANA.

The file scraping in generate_subtype.py is rather brittle. Hopefully
IANA won't find it necessary to change the format, but if they do that
file will likely need changed.

The file

rm_generated_files.sh

is provided to delete the generated files from ../generated/.

CHARACTER SET VERIFICATION:

The files,

check_character_sets.sh,
check_character_sets.py, and
check_character_sets.adb

are used to verify that every name and alias for a character set
recognized by IANA is recognized by the Basil library. The Ada program
takes the name or alias and searches for it in basil's character set
database. The python program uses urllib to fetch the database from
IANA and strip out all of the alias and character set names, and pipe
them into the Ada program. The shell script builds the Ada file, runs
the Python program, then cleans up the build of the Ada program. This
might be tedious if you want to run it multiple times, but useful for
automated building.

Again, it should be sufficient to run check_character_sets.sh.
