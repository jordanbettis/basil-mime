             BASIL LIBRARY FOR INTERNET MESSAGES AND MIME
                       Documentation Directory

This directory is a repository of printable TeX format documentation
for this library. Currently the only document available is the
Software Specification, stored in MRCY.SPC.002-Basil.tex.

This directory is managed with a makefile. To build the documentation,
run

make documentation

This will attempt to produce a dvi (from which you can produce
PostScript using a tool such as 'dvips') and a pdf. The dvi is
produced twice so that TeX can build the table of contents on the
first go and use it on the second.

A 'make clean' target is also provided to remove all the generated
files when you're done.

To build this directory, you need LaTeX2e. You also need the titling
and parskip packages, as well as the palatino font. They are provided
in most LaTeX distributions. This package also uses the parskip and
softwarespec packages, and those are provided in the directory.
